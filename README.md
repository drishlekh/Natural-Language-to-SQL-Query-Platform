# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Query-Platform

This is a web application built using Flask, which allows users to input a natural language query, and it converts the query into an SQL query for a MySQL database. The platform uses Groq's AI API (Llama-3.1-8b-instant model) to convert natural language into SQL queries.

## Features
- **Natural Language to SQL Conversion:** The app takes a natural language input and converts it into an SQL query.
- **Database Integration:** It is integrated with a MySQL database where queries are executed and results are displayed.
- **Real-time Results:** The results from the SQL query execution are displayed in real-time on the web interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Flask:** Python web framework for building the application.
- **MySQL:** The database used for storing and retrieving data.
- **LLM: Groq API (Llama-3.1-8b-instant model):** Used to convert natural language queries into SQL queries.
